<b>Important!</b><br/><br/>

This email contains an encrypted secret with JavaScript code that can be used to retrieve the secret without direct access to DecLegacy. We advise you not to delete this email, as it's a good idea to store important information in multiple virtual locations (DecLegacy + your email).
<br/> <br/>

We also recommend that you set up a recovery email with your email provider (e.g., Gmail) to ensure that someone can access this information if something unexpected happens.
